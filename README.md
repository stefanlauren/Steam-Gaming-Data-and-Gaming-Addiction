*Project date: Mar 2019*

The Tableau dashboard [Case Study - Gaming Addiction.twbx](https://github.com/stefanlauren/Steam-Gaming-Data-and-Gaming-Addiction/blob/main/Case%20Study%20-%20Gaming%20Addiction.twbx) tries to answer few questions:
- What is the percentage of gamers that became addicted to game (play more than 6 hours per day)?
- What games' genre contribute to the addiction?
- What games' title contribute to the addiction?
- Does the presence of group affect the playtime?
